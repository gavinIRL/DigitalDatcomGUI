# Digital Datcom+Pro GUI (unfinished and abandoned)

## **Background:**
The contents of this repo started as a candidate project for a Master's Thesis, but was completely abandoned prior to the literature review stage in favour of an alternative project (see [here](https://github.com/gavinUL/NNDatcom)) which did in fact utilise some of the code in this repo. Uploaded to Github by request so that potentially a future student could pick up and finish the features that were planned (in some cases there exists several placeholder tabs/buttons) but not yet implemented.

## **Plan/Concept:**
Create a GUI that would sit on top of the existing Digital Datcom+Pro software to enable less experienced users to make use of the software, and also reduce the amount of time required to create an input file. Java was chosen as the language for this project due to the more fluid GUI in comparison to other candidate languages, and also would provide a learning opportunity for the author to explore a new language.

## **Features:**
Creates an input file for use with the Digital Datcom+Pro software based on user input into a GUI which has all typical options available. Can also run the input file from the GUI and automatically open the results file. Limited import options for existing input files which can be prone to errors depending method of defining aircraft shape. Able to run multiple input files at once which vary a particular parameter.

## **Planned Features Not Implemented:**
Results viewer, input parameter sensitivity analysis by varying a particular parameter.
Contact author on Github for more detailed information on unimplemented features.
